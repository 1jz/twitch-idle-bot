# twitch-idle-bot
idle in all (or some) live twitch channels written in pure Go

This twitch bot idles in channels. It never says anything it just sits there. Menacingly.

Im not going to cover how to get the bot running or it's features as I did this for brushing up on Go and would prefer not having everyone idling all over twitch.

There are of course limitations the bot will hit such as join rates and incoming message rates, you are welcome to figure these out :)
